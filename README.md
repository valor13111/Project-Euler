# Project-Euler

Project Euler is a website which gives problems and tries to encourage differente paths to solving it. <br />
There is (almost) always a brute force way of solving a problem, but the key is to find a trick to solving it more <br />
efficiently. <br />
I will be trying to find the solutions using (most of the time) Java programming language.
